1. Ex01_Data_preparation.ipynb : In this file we prepared all the data of the dataframe for modeling and evaluation.
2. EX01_Imbalance.ipynb : In this file we test 3 different models for RandomForestClassifier (kind of hyper parameter tuning) together with cross-val-score evaluation. The results wasn't so good, but this is the best we could achieve.
3. EX01_Feature_Importance.ipynb, EX01_Balancing_and_Feature_test.ipynb : In these two files we tried a different approach with the models that come from imbalance package. We extract a feature importance table and we played with it over and over again to get the best result.
4. EX01_RandomForsetClassifier.ipynb : An earlier try to get some indication about our data.
5. EX01_RandomForsetRegressor.ipynb : An earlier try to get some indication about our data.
6. time_zones.csv : Helper data file to convert from state into true UTC time.
